# Thoth-LAN-Messaging-Service
Thoth is a simple, easy-to use LAN based, command line messaging service that helps members chat easily over their LAN networks.
Here's a simple guide to get started:
1. Run the server.py from your terminal in the folder.
2. Then create a text file named pw, like this pw.txt
3. In the text file type a password of your choice, make sure it's only integers though.
4. Hit enter and in the second line enter the local networks ipv4 address, save and close the text file.
5. Now run client.py in the terminal and enter your name, and then the password you had typed in the pw.txt file.
6. Start typing after logging in.

This is completely free and safe, since your messages are deleted once the terminal is closed and can be shared over the LAN only.
Pull requests are closed for now, Issues can be opened any-time!
For more info write to quantechlxxi.corp@gmail.com or add me on discord - cyber#7596.

The above given process is one time only, after doing so you can simply start the server and run the client.py file in your terminal.

Where this can be used:
1. Offices where data safety and privacy is of imprtance.
2. Schools for learning socket programming.
3. Gaming, because why not(ingame chats).
